## Manifest

### Notes 2020-04-09

- Naming - we don't want DevOps and CoDe is confusing. CI/CD or Continuous Delivery both could work.
- Online - no, maybe would be a good thing if we already had this started before covid-19. Maybe this will happen organically if needed. But this isn't a goal in itself.

- Start working with Jenkins+Gerrit+Repo tool
  - Can we make a good open source usability thing (considering manifest)?
  - Can we replace one tool at time with other making it more generic?
  - Can we replace Repo tool with Git submodules?

### This repo

- We develop stuff here, if something deserves a separate repo, we move it to a new one.
- Everything published is open source
- A new GitHub organization - code exchange (Malm√∂)

### Preparations

- Vote on stuff in advance
- A new slack
- Start small and grow organically
  - start with a few people we know will participate and like it
  - make sure that we actually can work with and help the person(s) we start with
- Have some topic semi-ready so that there is something to vote on (at least 3-4 at any given time)

### During the Friday thing

- Don't sell from stage
- We could do scatter hacks or open space; Where we pitch/select one idea to do talk about in advance
- "Topic of the day"
- The work we do with participant on Fridays, should if possible be open (sourced)
- We are in our new office
- Beers/beverages and snacks 14-17
- It should be a fun and relaxed time

### Ideas

- Jenkins and Gerrit and Repo tool
  - J + Luthander + M
  - Bobby?
- How and with what we can replace Jenkins?
  - how to make your CI portable - how to not paint yourself in a corner
  - on prem, cloud
  - when should you consider to move
  - how to prepare
    - portable pipelines
    - plugins
