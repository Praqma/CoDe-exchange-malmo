## Manifest

### This repo

- We develop stuff here, if something deserves a separate repo, we move it to a new one.
- Everything published is open source
- A new GitHub organization - code exchange (Malm√∂)

### Preparations

- Vote on stuff in advance
- A new slack
- Start small and grow organically
  - start with a few people we know will participate and like it
  - make sure that we actually can work with and help the person(s) we start with
- Have some topic semi-ready so that there is something to vote on (at least 3-4 at any given time)

### During the Friday thing

- Don't sell from stage
- We could do scatter hacks or open space; Where we pitch/select one idea to do talk about in advance
- "Topic of the day"
- The work we do with participant on Fridays, should if possible be open (sourced)
- We are in our new office
- Beers/beverages and snacks 14-17
- It should be a fun and relaxed time
